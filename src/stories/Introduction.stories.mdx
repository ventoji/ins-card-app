# Card App description

## Coding exercise

This is a simple app in react/js that allow us to add, remove or delete cards.

## Docs
Every component in the application is detailed in the storybook documentation.


## How to use it
Just click (+) button placed in the right side on the screen, add title, description and url for card image, in just click it. 
All cards ara stored in `localStorage`. If you want to edit or remove a card just pass the mouse over the card and options will be displayed.
The state of the application is handle by a simple store created using `redux`. When creating or editing a card there is a delay for closing the modal window.
